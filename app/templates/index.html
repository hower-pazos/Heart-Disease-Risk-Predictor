    <h1>Heart Disease Prediction Model</h1>

    <div class="model-description">
      <p>This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of heart disease
        based on various health indicators. The model is built using Python and popular data science libraries,
        including Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.</p>
      <h3>Dataset:</h3>
      <p>The project uses the "heart.csv" dataset obtained from <a
          href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset/data">Kaggle</a> which contains 1025
        instances with 14 attributes. The attributes include demographic information (age, sex), medical measurements
        (resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.), and a binary target variable indicating the presence or
        absence of heart disease.</p>

      <h3>Model Training and Evaluation</h3>
      <p>Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated using cross-validation and test set performance:
        Decision Tree Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting Classifier,
        Random Forest Classifier, and a Stacking Classifier. The models were trained on the scaled training data, and
        their performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</p>

    <p>The Naive Bayes Classifier achieved the highest test accuracy of 85.25% after hyperparameter tuning,
      outperforming other models, including Random Forest (83.61%) and SVM (77.05%).</p>
